For compatibility, start with Solaris 10u9, and then patch forward using the 
PCA utility.

PCA automates the process of downloading and applying patches in Solaris, 
which is a good thing, because patching is f-awful.


1- Install PCA from http://www.par.univie.ac.at/solaris/pca/
2- Make a directory called 'patches' to stage the downloaded patch files.
3- Check that you have a current patch list (patch_list_events) from
   the client.

   ./pca --user=<oracle_account> --passwd=<oracle_pwd> \
         --patchdir ./patches --download patch_list_events_2.1

4- Watch it run.
